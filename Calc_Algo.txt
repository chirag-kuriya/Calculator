Create 2 Empty stack
  1st for values
  2nd for operators

Traverse the input of user from left to right.

start of the loop
 
if : char is number push into stack

else if : operator stack is empty or at the top of stack char = '(' then push char

else if : char = ')' then 

    while we did not find '(' in stack 
        calculate the value and push the value in to value stack and pop the operator
  
    pop the '(' from operator stack

else :

    if : traversed char is equal to + or - then calculate the value and push into value stack
    and pop the operator and push new char

    if : traversed char is equal to * or /
    
      if : top of the operator stack value is * or /
           then calculate the value and push into value stack
           and pop the operator and push new char
    
      else :  Direct push the traversed char in to operator stack
    
end of the loop

while ( stack size > 1 )
   pop top 2 value and on operator and calculate the value

print the value
